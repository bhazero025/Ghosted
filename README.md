Ghosted -- Team members Steffen Camarato, Bruno Harger Alves, Vikki Horn, and Nicolas Jaramillo created a dating application aimed at solving one of the problems often encountered in modern data apps -- anonymity. The app leverages resources from VoIP Innovations, Flowroute, Avaya Zang, and Telnyx to mask phone numbers while still allowing people looking for love to communicate with each other via SMS, MMS, and voice. If at any point the love connection just isn't there, users can "ghost" their connections, eliminating the worry that comes with people not handling rejection well.
